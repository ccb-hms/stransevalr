I am a bit confused about the concepts of the 3 things: FDR, FDR adjusted p-value and q-value, which I initially thought I was clear about. Are FDR adjusted p-value the same as q-value? (my understanding is that FDR adjusted p-value = original p-value * number of genes/rank of the gene, is that right?) When people say xxx genes are differentially expressed with an FDR cutoff of 0.05, does that mean xxx genes have an FDR adjusted p-value smaller than 0.05?	"The thing to understand is that terms like FDR and q-value were defined in specific ways by their original inventors but are used in more generic ways by later researchers who adapt, modify or use the ideas.The term """"false discovery rate (FDR)"""" was created by Benjamini and Hochberg in their 1995 paper. They gave a particular definition of what they meant by FDR.  Their procedure accepted or rejected hypotheses, but did not produce adjusted p-values.Benjamini and Yekutieli presented another more conservative algorithm to control the FDR in a 2001 paper. Same definition of FDR, but a different algorithm.In 2002, I re-interpreted the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) and Benjamini and Yekutieli (BY) procedures in terms of adjusted p-values. I implemented the resulting algorithms in the function p.adjust() in the stats package, and used them in the limma package, and this lead to the concept of an FDR adjusted p-value. The terminology used by the p.adjust() function and limma packages has lead people to refer to """"BH adjusted p-values"""".The adjusted p-value definition that you give is essentially the same as the BH adjusted p-value, except that you omitted the last step in the procedure. Your definition as it stands is not an increasing function of the original p-values.In 2002, John Storey created a new definition of """"false discovery rate"""". Storey's definition is based on Benjamini and Hochberg's original idea, but is mathematically a bit more flexible. John Storey also created the terminology """"q-value"""" for a quantity that estimates his definition of FDR. He implemented q-value estimation procedures in an R package called qvalue. Another important but often overlooked difference is the idea of FDR """"estimation"""" vs FDR """"control"""". The qvalue package attempts to give a more or less unbiased estimate of the FDR, so the true FDR is about equally likely to be greater or less in practice. The BH approach instead controls the expected FDR. It guarantees that the true FDR rate will be less than the specified rate on average if you do an exactly similar experiment over and over again. So the BH approach is slightly more conservative than qvalue. The BH properties hold regardless of the number of p-values, while qvalue is asymptotic, so the BH approach is more robust than qvalue when the number of hypotheses being tested isn't very large.So, strictly speaking, the q-value and the FDR adjusted p-value are similar but not quite the same. However the terms q-value and FDR adjusted p-value are often used generically by the Bioconductor community to refer to any quantity that controls or estimates any definition of the FDR. In this general sense the terms are synonyms.The lesson to draw from this is that different methods and different packages are trying to do slighty different things and give slightly different results, and you should always cite the specific software and method that you have used."	"The False Discovery Rate (FDR) is a statistical method used in multiple hypothesis testing to correct for the problem of multiple comparisons. It is designed to control the expected proportion of """"discoveries"""" (rejected null hypotheses) that are false (incorrect rejections). The FDR is a method of conceptualizing the rate of type I errors in null hypothesis testing when conducting multiple comparisons [doc4].

FDR adjusted p-values, also known as q-values, are the minimal FDR at which the test may be called significant. In other words, the q-value is the smallest FDR at which a particular result would be deemed significant. The q-value is a measure of significance in terms of FDR rather than the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) that the traditional p-value measures. The q-value is calculated based on the p-value, but it also takes into account the number of hypotheses tested .

Your understanding of FDR adjusted p-value is not entirely correct. The FDR adjusted p-value (or q-value) is not simply the original p-value multiplied by the number of genes divided by the rank of the gene. The calculation of q-values involves a procedure that adjusts the p-values based on the proportion of null hypotheses and the distribution of p-values, not just the rank of the individual test [doc4].

When people say """"xxx genes are differentially expressed with an FDR cutoff of 0.05"""", it means that these genes have an FDR adjusted p-value (or q-value) smaller than 0.05. This means that if you call these genes differentially expressed, you can expect that 5% of these calls are false positives .

Please note that this model works only on the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages. For more detailed information, you may want to refer to the original papers or the Bioconductor website (https://bioconductor.org)."	"FDR, FDR adjusted p-value, and q-value are all related concepts used in multiple hypothesis testing to control the false discovery rate. Let's break down each term:

1. FDR (False Discovery Rate): This is a method used in multiple hypothesis testing to correct for the problem of multiple comparisons. It is the expected proportion of false positives among the rejected hypotheses. The FDR is a less stringent condition than the family-wise error rate (FWER), so it has greater power at the cost of increased false positives.

2. FDR adjusted p-value: This is a p-value that has been adjusted using a method (like the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) that controls the FDR. The adjustment is not as simple as original p-value * number of tests / rank of the test. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, for example, ranks the p-values, and then the adjusted p-value for the i-th ranked p-value is calculated as (p-value * total number of tests) / i. The adjusted p-values are then often """"minimized"""" to ensure they are monotonically increasing.

3. Q-value: The q-value of a test measures the minimum FDR at which the test may be called significant. In other words, it's the smallest FDR at which you would reject the null hypothesis. The q-value is similar to the FDR adjusted p-value, but while the adjusted p-value is a correction of the p-value, the q-value is a property of the test itself.

When people say """"xxx genes are differentially expressed with an FDR cutoff of 0.05"""", they mean that these genes have an FDR adjusted p-value (or q-value, depending on the context) less than 0.05. This means that if you call these genes differentially expressed, you can expect 5% of them to be false positives."
I am working on RNA-Seq data. I'm using DESeq2 for my analysis. I have 20 samples from 3 batches. I am testing for 2 conditions, cond1 and cond2.dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countTable3, colData = coldata, design = ~cond1 * cond2). When i performed PCA, I could clearly see some batch effect. I read in the forum that adding batch to the design in DESeq removes the batch effect. But I am not sure if this is the right way to go about it because I can still see the same batch effect dds <-DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countTable3, colData = coldata, design = ~batch+cond1*cond2) I tried using Combat but I'm unable to use combat results in DESeq. It gives me the following error.Error in DESeqDataSet(se, design = design, ignoreRank) : some values in assay are negative . I am not sure if removeBatchEffects() function can be used with DESeq. Can someone please help me out here.	"Just to be clear, there's an important difference between removing a batch effect and modelling a batch effect. Including the batch in your design formula will model the batch effect in the regression step, which means that the raw data are not modified (so the batch effect is not removed), but instead the regression will estimate the size of the batch effect and subtract it out when performing all other tests. In addition, the model's residual degrees of freedom will be reduced appropriately to reflect the fact that some degrees of freedom were """"spent"""" modelling the batch effects. This is the preferred approach for any method that is capable of using it (this includes DESeq2). You would only remove the batch effect (e.g. using limma's removeBatchEffect function) if you were going to do some kind of downstream analysis that can't model the batch effects, such as training a classifier.Batch effects are gene-specific, and DESeq2 fits gene-specific coefficients for the batch term. If you want to get an idea how much batch variability contributes to a PCA plot, I've recommended the following approach on the support site before: variance stabilize the counts, apply limma's removeBatchEffect to assay(vsd), then use plotPCA to plot the residuals. An example: Make some simulated data with a batch effect: dds <- makeExampleDESeqDataSet(betaSD 1,interceptMean=10) dds$batch <- factor(rep(c(""""A"""",""""B""""),each=6)) VST, remove batch effect, then plotPCA: vsd <- vst(dds) plotPCA(vsd, """"batch"""") assay(vsd) <- limma::removeBatchEffect(assay(vsd), vsd$batch) plotPCA(vsd, """"batch"""")"	"It seems like you're dealing with a common issue in RNA-Seq data analysis, which is the presence of batch effects. Batch effects can be introduced due to various reasons such as different sample preparation, sequencing date, etc., and it's crucial to correct for these effects to ensure the validity of your downstream analysis.

In DESeq2, including the batch variable in the design formula is one way to account for batch effects. However, this method assumes that the batch effects are linear and can be modeled as such. If the batch effects in your data are more complex, this method might not completely remove them, which could be why you're still observing batch effects in your PCA plot.

The ComBat method from the sva package is another popular method for batch effect correction. However, as you've noticed, ComBat can sometimes result in negative values in the corrected data, which is not compatible with DESeq2 as it expects count data. 

One possible solution is to use the `ComBat_seq` function from the sva package, which is an extension of ComBat specifically designed for count data from RNA-Seq experiments [doc1]. Here's an example of how you can use it:

```R
library(sva)
# Assuming 'counts' is your count matrix and 'batch' is a vector specifying the batch for each sample
combat_edata = ComBat_seq(counts=counts, batch=batch)
```

After running `ComBat_seq`, you can then proceed with DESeq2 analysis using the batch-corrected data.

Another approach is to use the RUVSeq package, which provides several methods for removing unwanted variation, including batch effects, from RNA-Seq data [doc2]. The RUVg function from RUVSeq uses control genes to estimate the factors of unwanted variation. 

```R
library(RUVSeq)
# Assuming 'counts' is your count matrix, 'batch' is a vector specifying the batch for each sample, and 'cIdx' is a vector of control gene indices
set <- newSeqExpressionSet(as.matrix(counts))
set <- RUVg(set, cIdx, k=1)
```

Please note that these methods require careful consideration and understanding of your data. It's always a good idea to visualize your data before and after batch correction to assess the effectiveness of the correction.

Lastly, remember that this model works only on the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages. If you need more specific advice, I recommend referring to the Bioconductor website or the specific package vignettes."	"In DESeq2, adding the batch effect in the design formula is indeed the correct way to account for batch effects. However, it's important to note that this doesn't remove the batch effect from the data, but rather it adjusts for it in the statistical model. This means that you might still see the batch effect in a PCA plot, because the raw data still contains the batch effect.

The error you're getting when trying to use ComBat is because ComBat can produce negative values, which are not allowed in DESeq2. DESeq2 uses a negative binomial model, which requires count data, and count data cannot be negative.

The `removeBatchEffect()` function is from the limma package, not DESeq2. It's used to remove batch effects from log-transformed data for the purpose of making plots, not for differential expression analysis. It's not appropriate to use this function on the raw count data, and the results should not be used as input to DESeq2.

If you're still seeing a batch effect in your PCA plot after including the batch in the design formula, it might be because the batch effect is very strong, or it might be due to other factors. It's also possible that the batch effect is confounded with your conditions of interest, which can make it difficult to separate the two.

You might want to consider consulting with a statistician or bioinformatician who is familiar with RNA-seq data analysis. They can help you figure out the best way to handle the batch effect in your specific situation."
I am new in this kind of analysis and I have a .csv file containing RNA-Seq data from different cell lines (with at least 3 replicates) normalised to TPM already, unfortunately I cannot access to the raw counts files.Is there a way I can follow to obtain the p-values, t-values and padj starting from TPM values in order to perform a differential expression analysis? I read about DESeq, DESeq2, EdgeR, limma and it looks like if all the R packages would ask for the raw counts and not from TPM values?	There is no good way to do a DE analysis of RNA-seq data starting from the TPM values. TPMs just throw away too much information about the original count sizes. Sorry, but I'm not willing to make any recommendations, except to dissuade people from thinking that TPMs are an adequate summary of an RNA-seq experiment.Note that it is not possible to create a DGEList object or CPM values from TPMs, so trying to use code designed for these sort of objects will be counter-productive.I see that some people in the literature have done limma analyses of the log(TPM+1) values and, horrible though that is, I can't actually think of anything better, given TPMs and existing software. One could make this a little better by using eBayes with trend=TRUE and by using arrayWeights() to try to partially recover the library sizes.	"Yes, you're correct that many differential expression analysis packages such as DESeq, DESeq2, and edgeR typically require raw counts as input. This is because these methods incorporate statistical models that account for the discrete nature of count data and the variability associated with sequencing depth.

However, the Linnorm package in Bioconductor can work with TPM (Transcripts Per Million) normalized data, among other types, for differential expression analysis. The Linnorm package performs a transformation on the data to make it more Gaussian-like, which can then be used for various downstream analyses, including differential expression analysis.

Here's an example of how you can use the Linnorm package for differential expression analysis with TPM data:

```R
# Load the Linnorm package
library(Linnorm)

# Assuming 'datamatrix' is your TPM data
# 'design' is your design matrix for the limma analysis
# Set 'RowSamples' to TRUE if each row is a sample and each column is a feature
# Set 'output' to """"DEResults"""" to get a matrix of Differential Expression Analysis Results
# Set 'output' to """"Both"""" to get a list that contains both Differential Expression Analysis Results and the transformed data matrix

results <- Linnorm.limma(datamatrix, design, RowSamples = TRUE, output = """"DEResults"""")
```

The output will be a matrix with Differential Expression Analysis Results with the following columns:

- logFC: Log 2 Fold Change
- XPM: Average Expression. If input is raw count or CPM, this column has the CPM unit. If input is RPKM, FPKM or TPM, this column has the TPM unit.
- t: moderated t-statistic
- P.Value: p value
- adj.P.Val: Adjusted p value. This is also called False Discovery Rate or q value.
- B: log odds that the feature is differential [doc1].

Please note that the design matrix is required for the limma analysis. You can refer to the limma documentation or the Linnorm vignettes for more details on how to create this design matrix.

Remember, this model works only on the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages. If you need more specific advice, please refer to https://bioconductor.org."	"You're correct that DESeq2, EdgeR, and limma are commonly used R packages for differential expression analysis, and they typically require raw counts as input. This is because these methods use statistical models that are based on the raw counts, and they also account for library size differences and biological variance in their models.

However, if you only have TPM (Transcripts Per Million) normalized data, you can still perform differential expression analysis, but you need to use methods that are appropriate for this type of data. Here are a few options:

1. **Limma-voom**: This is a method within the limma package that is designed to work with log-transformed count data, like TPM. It estimates the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a precision weight for each observation and then enters these into the limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline.

2. **edgeR-robust**: This is a method within the edgeR package that can be used with TPM data. It uses a quasi-likelihood F-test to model the mean-variance relationship of the data.

3. **Non-parametric tests**: If you don't have many replicates, you might consider using non-parametric tests like the Mann-Whitney U test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. These tests do not make any assumptions about the distribution of your data.

4. **Machine Learning Approaches**: You can also use machine learning approaches like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forests for differential expression analysis. These methods can handle TPM data and can be useful if you have a large number of samples.

Remember, the results you get from these methods will not be exactly the same as what you would get from DESeq2 or edgeR with raw counts, because the statistical models are different. But they can still provide useful information about differential expression in your data.

Also, keep in mind that TPM normalization only accounts for sequencing depth and gene length, but not for compositional differences between samples. This means that if one gene is highly expressed in a sample, it can cause other genes to appear less expressed. This is a limitation of TPM and other similar normalization methods."
"I am testing salmon and kallisto for RNA-seq. Both tools output ESTIMATED counts and TPM.  My questions are: 1. from the help of tximport function:countsFromAbundance:character, either """"no"""" (default), """"scaledTPM"""", or """"lengthScaledTPM"""", for whether to generate estimated counts using abundance estimates scaled up to library size (scaledTPM) or additionally scaled using the average transcript length over samples and the library size (lengthScaledTPM). if using scaledTPM or lengthScaledTPM, then the counts are no longer correlated with average transcript length, and so the length offset matrix should not be used.To my understanding, TPM is a unit that scaled by (effective) feature length first and then sequencing depth. So, what are scaledTPM and lengthScaled TPM? does tximport use the estimate counts to get the TPM? 2. what's the difference among the TPM output by salmon/kallisto and the TPM returned by tximport function? 3. How does tximport mathematically convert counts to TPM if use the estimated counts to get the TPM?"	To answer your questions:1) scaledTPM is TPM's scaled up to library size, while lengthScaledTPM first multiplies TPM by feature length and then scales up to library size. These are then quantities that are on the same scale as original counts, except no longer correlated with feature length across samples.2) No difference. tximport is simply importing the TPMs and providing them back to the user as a matrix (txOut=TRUE), or summarizing these values among isoforms of a gene (txOut=FALSE).3) Counts are never converted to TPMs. The default is to import the estimated counts and estimated TPMs from the quantification files, and then summarize these to the gene level.	"The `tximport` function in the Bioconductor package is used to import transcript-level estimates for various types of RNA-seq data. The `countsFromAbundance` argument in this function can take three values: """"no"""", """"scaledTPM"""", or """"lengthScaledTPM"""". These options determine how the function generates estimated counts using abundance estimates [doc1][doc2].

1. """"scaledTPM"""" and """"lengthScaledTPM"""" are methods to generate estimated counts from abundance estimates. TPM (Transcripts Per Million) is indeed a unit that is scaled by feature length and sequencing depth. However, """"scaledTPM"""" and """"lengthScaledTPM"""" are slightly different. When """"scaledTPM"""" is used, the abundance estimates are scaled up to the library size. When """"lengthScaledTPM"""" is used, the abundance estimates are additionally scaled using the average transcript length over samples and the library size. If either """"scaledTPM"""" or """"lengthScaledTPM"""" is used, the counts are no longer correlated with average transcript length, and so the length offset matrix should not be used [doc1].

2. The TPM output by Salmon/Kallisto and the TPM returned by the `tximport` function are essentially the same. They both represent Transcripts Per Million, which is a measure of transcript abundance. However, the way they are calculated might be slightly different depending on the specific settings and parameters used in Salmon/Kallisto and `tximport` [doc1][doc2].

3. The `tximport` function does not directly convert counts to TPM. Instead, it imports the TPM values that were calculated by the software used for transcript quantification (like Salmon or Kallisto). The TPM values are calculated by the quantification software based on the number of reads mapped to each transcript and the length of the transcript, normalized by the total number of mapped reads [doc1].

Please note that this information is based on the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages. For more specific or detailed information, you may want to refer to the documentation of the specific packages or functions you are using, or consult the Bioconductor website (https://bioconductor.org)."	"1. ScaledTPM and lengthScaledTPM are methods used by tximport to generate estimated counts from abundance estimates. TPM (Transcripts Per Million) is indeed a unit that is scaled by feature length and sequencing depth. However, scaledTPM and lengthScaledTPM are slightly different. 

   - scaledTPM: This method scales the TPM values up to the library size. This means that the estimated counts are proportional to the TPM values, but scaled up so that the total matches the total library size.
   
   - lengthScaledTPM: This method additionally scales the TPM values using the average transcript length over samples and the library size. This means that the estimated counts are no longer correlated with the average transcript length.

   Tximport does not use the estimated counts to get the TPM. Instead, it uses the TPM to get the estimated counts.

2. The TPM output by Salmon/Kallisto and the TPM returned by tximport function might be slightly different due to the different methods used to calculate them. Salmon/Kallisto calculate TPM directly from the raw read counts, while tximport uses the scaledTPM or lengthScaledTPM method to generate estimated counts from the TPM values.

3. Tximport does not directly convert counts to TPM. Instead, it uses the TPM values provided by Salmon/Kallisto to generate estimated counts. The mathematical details of this process are complex and depend on the specific method used (scaledTPM or lengthScaledTPM). However, in general, it involves scaling the TPM values up to the library size (and possibly also by the average transcript length), so that the total matches the total number of reads in the library."
In all RNA-seq analysis applications they talk about the dispersion of a gene. As far as I understood, it is not a variance of the normalized counts for a given gene. It is somehow much more complicated. But what would a dispersion of 0.19 or a dispersion of 0.80 tell me? Can I still interpret it as a variance of a gene?	"The most complete explanation of what the dispersion means from a scientific point of view is probably in the edgeR glm paper: http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/10/4288. See the first section of Results in conjunction with the first section of Methods. That article characterized sqrt(dispersion) as the """"biological coefficient of variation (BCV)"""", and that is the terminology we have used since in the edgeR articles and documentation. The BCV is the relative variability of expression between biological replicates. If you estimate dispersion = 0.19, then sqrt(dispersion) = BCV = 0.44. This means that the expression values vary up and down by 44% between replicates.An important point, that is easy to miss, is that the BCV measures the relative variability of true expression levels, not the variability of measured expression levels. The BCV represents the relative variability that you would observe if you were able to measure the true expression levels perfectly in each RNA sample, even though one can't actually do that. It represents the variability that remains after the Poisson variability from sequencing has been removed.To repeat, BCV does not represent the variability between observed expression levels. It is the variability of true expression levels. You cannot measure BCV using an undergraduate formula from the observed counts or RPKM values."	"The dispersion parameter in RNA-seq analysis, particularly in packages like DESeq2, edgeR, and DSS, is a measure of biological variability for a given gene across different samples or conditions. It is not the same as the variance of normalized counts for a gene, but it does play a similar role in quantifying variability.

In the context of RNA-seq data, the counts are often modeled using a negative binomial distribution, which is characterized by a mean and a dispersion parameter. The dispersion parameter in this context is used to model the biological variability that is not explained by the mean of the distribution. A higher dispersion value indicates a higher degree of variability that is not explained by the mean.

For example, a dispersion of 0.19 would indicate a lower level of unexplained variability for a gene across samples or conditions, while a dispersion of 0.80 would indicate a higher level of unexplained variability. However, it's important to note that these values are relative and their interpretation may depend on the specific context of the experiment and the data.

In summary, while the dispersion parameter does quantify variability, it is not the same as variance and should not be interpreted as such. It is a measure of the overdispersion or extra variability observed in count data beyond what is expected under a Poisson distribution, which is often used as a starting point for modeling count data [doc1][doc2][doc3][doc4].

Please note that this model works only on the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages. For more specific information, you may want to refer to the documentation of the specific Bioconductor package you are using or consult with a statistician or bioinformatician."	"In RNA-seq analysis, dispersion refers to the variability of gene expression across different samples or conditions. It's a measure of how much the expression of a gene varies from sample to sample, beyond what would be expected from the Poisson distribution (which assumes that the variance is equal to the mean). 

Dispersion is not the same as variance, although they are related concepts. Variance measures the spread of a set of data points around their mean value, while dispersion in this context measures the variability of gene expression across different samples.

A dispersion value of 0.19 or 0.80 does not directly tell you the variance of a gene, but it does give you an idea of how variable the gene's expression is across different samples. A higher dispersion value indicates a higher degree of variability. 

In the context of differential expression analysis, genes with high dispersion values are often of particular interest because they may be differentially expressed across different conditions. However, it's also important to note that high dispersion can also be due to technical variability or noise, so it's important to interpret these values in the context of the overall analysis."
"I know findOverlaps() from GenomicRanges package does pretty good job for finding overlapped regions.I have studied whole vignette of GenomicRanges, BiocParallel pakages. findOverlaps function is very well done, but I need element wise operation across several GRanges objects simultaneously.

You also want to keep only the most significant overlap (based on score) when multiple overlaps are found. 

The `bplapply` function from the BiocParallel package can be used to apply a function to each element of a list or vector in parallel, which could be useful for your case. However, you would need to write a custom function that encapsulates the steps you described (finding overlaps, keeping the most significant one, performing chi-square test, etc.) and then apply this function to each element of your GRanges objects using `bplapply`.

Here is a rough sketch of how you might do this:

```R
library(BiocParallel)
library(GenomicRanges)

# Define your custom function
overlap_func <- function(query, targets, gamma=1e-8) {
  overlaps <- lapply(targets, function(target) {
    ov <- target[subjectHits(findOverlaps(query, target))]
    if (length(ov) > 0) {
      ov[which.max(ov$score)]
    } else {
      NULL
    }
  })
  comb.pval <- chisq.test(sapply(c(query, overlaps), function(x) x$score))$p.value
  if (comb.pval > gamma) {
    GRangesList('querySample'=query, 'targetSample_1'=overlaps[[1]], 'targetSample_2'=overlaps[[2]])
  } else {
    NULL
  }
}

# Apply the function to each element of 'a' in parallel
result <- bplapply(seq_along(a), function(i) overlap_func(a[i], list(b, c)))

# Filter out NULL results
result <- result[!sapply(result, is.null)]

# Convert to data frame and write to file
res.df <- do.call(rbind, lapply(result, as.data.frame))
write.table(res.df, file=""""Confirmed.bed"""", row.names=FALSE)
```

Please note that this is a rough sketch and might need adjustments based on your specific needs. Also, the parallelization might not bring significant speedup if the number of elements in your GRanges objects is not very large, or if the computation for each element is not very time-consuming.

Remember to adjust the number of cores used by `bplapply` according to your system's capabilities. You can do this using the `register` function from the BiocParallel package.

Please refer to the documentation of the GenomicRanges [doc3], BiocParallel, and other relevant packages for more details. Also, note that this model works only on the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages. If you need further assistance, you may want to consider asking your question on the Bioconductor support site: https://support.bioconductor.org."	"It seems like you're trying to perform an element-wise operation across multiple GRanges objects simultaneously. Here's a possible approach using the `bplapply` function from the BiocParallel package. This function applies a function to each element of a list or vector in parallel.

First, you need to create a list of your GRanges objects:

```R
gr_list <- list(a, b, c)
```

Next, define a function that performs the operations you want on a single GRanges object:

```R
process_gr <- function(gr) {
  queryRange <- gr[1]
  ov_b <- b[subjectHits(findOverlaps(gr[1], b))]
  ov_c <- c[subjectHits(findOverlaps(gr[1], c))]
  
  ov_b_keepOne <- ov_b[which.max(ov_b$score)]
  ov_c_KeepOne <- ov_c[which.max(ov_c$score)]
  
  comb.pval <- chisq.test(c(queryRange$score, ov_b$score, ov_c$score))$p.value
  
  if (comb.pval > 1e-8) {
    res <- GRangesList('querySample'=queryRange, 'targetSample_1'=ov_b_keepOne, 'targetSample_2'=ov_c_KeepOne)
    res.df <- as.data.frame(res)
    write.table(res.df, file=paste0(""""Confirmed_"""", which(gr_list == gr), """".bed""""))
  }
}
```

Finally, use `bplapply` to apply this function to each GRanges object in your list:

```R
library(BiocParallel)
register(MulticoreParam(4))  # Adjust the number of cores as needed
bplapply(gr_list, process_gr)
```

This will create a separate .bed file for each GRanges object in your list. If you want to combine all the results into a single .bed file, you can modify the `process_gr` function to return `res.df` instead of writing it to a file, and then use `do.call(rbind, bplapply(gr_list, process_gr))` to combine all the results into a single data frame.

Please note that this is a basic example and you might need to adjust it to fit your specific needs. Also, parallel processing can speed up computations, but it also requires more memory. Make sure your machine has enough memory to handle the increased load."

The Homo.sapiens OrangismDb is based on the org.Hs.eg.db gene annotation package, and the TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene package; it is relatively easy to make a custom package if you have different annotations.'column' is the type of gene identifier you are interested in mapping to. See columns(Homo.sapiens) for some ideas.{    g <- genes(db, columns=column)This line extracts the coordinates (min and max) of each gene, as well as the column (e.g., SYMBOL associated with that gene.The TxDb is organized around a primary key (the ENTREZID), and there may be several gene SYMBOLS per ENTREZID.

'column' needs to match 'column' in the geneRanges() function.{    olaps <- findOverlaps(query, subject, ...)findOverlaps() is a very powerful function. It returns a 'Hits' object that has two parallel vectors. The vectors can be extracted with queryHits() and subjectHits(). queryHits() are the indexes of the queries (the gene coordinates) that overlap the corresponding subjectHits(), i.e., the indexes of the subjects, the copy number regions. The next lines line up the query column identifier (e.g., gene SYMBOL) that overlaps each subject.    f1 <- factor(subjectHits(olaps), levels=seq_len(subjectLength(olaps)))    splitAsList(mcols(x)[[column]][queryHits(olaps)], f1)the use of factor() with exactly as many levels as there are subjects ensures that the splitAsList() command returns a 1:1 mapping between the subjects (copy number regions) and the genes in the corresponding CharacterList.Another approach uses Steffen Durink's fine biomaRt package, a  contribution to Bioconductor of many year's standing.

In general we recommend this: the standard Bioc data types promote interoperability between different packages.  In this particular case -- gene symbols mapped to copy number regions -- you may wish to preserve the original TCGA-reported regions in a GRanges object, and then represent the mapped genes as GRanges metadata.  However (and as Herve' helpfully pointed out to me) this relationship could be one-to-many, or many-to-one, and the data structure can get a little complicated - though still very useful."	"To map the coordinates of genes to gene symbols, you can use the Bioconductor package `RTCGAToolbox`. This package provides a function called `makeSummarizedExperimentFromGISTIC` which can create a `SummarizedExperiment` from FireHose GISTIC data. This function takes as input a `FirehoseGISTIC-class` object and returns a `SummarizedExperiment` object [doc1].

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```R
# First, get the Firehose data
co <- getFirehoseData(""""COAD"""", clinical = FALSE, GISTIC = TRUE, destdir = tempdir())

# Then, create a SummarizedExperiment from the GISTIC data
makeSummarizedExperimentFromGISTIC(co, """"AllByGene"""")
```

In this example, `""""COAD""""` is the name of the cancer type, and `""""AllByGene""""` is the type of data to create the `SummarizedExperiment` from. The function `getFirehoseData` is used to download the data from the Firehose project, and `makeSummarizedExperimentFromGISTIC` is used to create the `SummarizedExperiment` [doc1].

Please note that this model works only on the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages. If you need more specific help, you may want to refer to the Bioconductor website at https://bioconductor.org."	"Mapping genomic coordinates to gene symbols is a common task in bioinformatics. Here's a general approach you can follow:

1. **Download a gene annotation file**: You can download a gene annotation file from databases like UCSC Genome Browser, Ensembl, or NCBI. This file should contain information about the genomic coordinates of each gene (chromosome, start, and end) and the corresponding gene symbol.

2. **Parse the annotation file**: You will need to write a script (in Python, R, or another language) to parse this file and create a data structure (like a dictionary or a hash table) that maps from genomic coordinates to gene symbols.

3. **Map coordinates to genes**: Using the data structure you created, you can now map the coordinates in your CNV file to gene symbols. For each row in your CNV file, you will need to look up the corresponding gene symbol in your data structure.

Here's a more specific example using Python and the `pandas` library:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the gene annotation file
annotations = pd.read_csv('annotations.csv')

# Load the CNV file
cnv = pd.read_csv('cnv.csv')

# Merge the two dataframes on the chromosome, start, and end columns
merged = pd.merge(cnv, annotations, on=['chromosome', 'start', 'end'])

# The merged dataframe now contains a column with the gene symbols
```

This is a simplified example and might not work perfectly for your specific case. The exact details will depend on the format of your CNV and annotation files. If you're not familiar with programming, you might want to ask for help from a bioinformatician or a data scientist."
How can I filter out the genes with low read counts using DESeq2? Is this the right approach:dds<-DESEq(dt)count<-counts(dds,normalize=TRUE)filter<-rowsum(count)> 10	If you want to filter out genes with low expression, you can do so before running DESeq:dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)idx <- rowSums( counts(dds, normalized=TRUE) >= 5 ) >= 3This would say, e.g. filter out genes where there are less than 3 samples with normalized counts greater than or equal to 5.then:dds <- dds[idx,]dds <- DESeq(dds)However, you typically don't need to pre-filter because independent filtering occurs within results() to save you from multiple test correction on genes with no power (see ?results and the vignette section about independent filtering, or the paper). The main reason to pre-filter would be to increase speed. Designs with many samples and many interaction terms can slow down on genes which have very few reads.	"Yes, you are on the right track. However, the function you are using, `rowsum()`, is not the correct one for this task. You should use `rowSums()` instead. Here is the correct approach:

```R
dds <- DESeq(dt)
count <- counts(dds, normalize=TRUE)
filter <- rowSums(count) > 10
```

This will create a logical vector (`filter`) that is `TRUE` for genes with a total normalized count greater than 10 across all samples, and `FALSE` otherwise. You can then use this vector to subset your count matrix:

```R
filtered_count <- count[filter,]
```

This will give you a new count matrix (`filtered_count`) that only includes genes with a total normalized count greater than 10.

Remember, the threshold of 10 is arbitrary and you might need to adjust it based on your specific dataset and research question. 

Also, note that DESeq2 has built-in mechanisms for handling genes with low counts. When you run the `DESeq()` function, it internally estimates size factors and applies normalization. It also uses independent filtering during the results step to maximize the number of genes that pass the significance threshold. This is based on the mean normalized count of each gene [doc1][doc3].

Please note that this model works only on the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages. If you need more specific advice, please refer to the DESeq2 vignette or the Bioconductor website (https://bioconductor.org)."	"Yes, you are on the right track. DESeq2 is a popular package for differential gene expression analysis. However, there are a few corrections to be made in your approach. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. First, you need to create a DESeqDataSet from your count data. Assuming `dt` is your count data and `colData` is your sample information:

```R
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = dt, colData = colData, design = ~ condition)
```

2. Then, you can filter out the genes with low read counts. A common approach is to remove genes which have low counts across all samples. For example, you might want to keep genes that have at least 10 reads in total:

```R
keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10
dds <- dds[keep,]
```

3. After filtering, you can proceed with the normalization and differential expression analysis:

```R
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

Remember to replace `condition` with your actual condition or factor of interest. Also, adjust the threshold (10 in this case) according to your specific needs or based on the distribution of your data."
"I am analysing my RNA-Seq data with DESeq2. At the end I would like to convert significantly expressed  ensembl IDs to GeneSymbols. I am using AnnotationDbi for this. However, I realized that not all the ensembl IDs are converted to Gene Symbols. 25072 out of 48607 returned as NA. More than 11000 of these IDs are actually significantly differentially expressed .  So to double check, I put the IDs which got """"NA"""" for Gene Symbol to Biomart and it converted them to Gene symbols. So now I am confused, am I doing something wrong ? Or is there any other alternative to extract all Gene symbols?"	"You can use the ensembldb package to do the mapping between Ensembl gene IDs and gene names (or symbols). You would need also one of the EnsDb packages providing the actual annotation (such as EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75 for genome release GRCh37 or EnsDb.Hsapiens.v79 vor GRCh38). Check the ensembldb vignette for more information (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ensembldb/inst/doc/ensembldb.html).You could basically use the same AnnotationDbi call that you use, but provide the EnsDB object instead of the org.Hs.eg.db object.Just one clarification: the gene names that are listed above in your table are not gene symbols. These are rather the names for the gene that are provided by Ensembl. For protein coding genes the gene names correspond however to the HGNC symbols.The OrgDb packages are a collection of data from many different sources, NCBI, UCSC, Ensembl, etc. The packages are Entrez gene centric in that we start with the list of Entrez gene ids from NCBI and annotate to that id. Data downloaded from Ensembl is matched to the Entrez gene id, if no mapping between the two exists then the Ensembl id doesn't end up in the OrgDb package.Starting from three example ENSEMBL gene IDs:ensemblGenes <- c(""""ENSG00000108958"""", """"ENSG00000123009"""", """"ENSG00000124399"""") symbols <- c(""""AC016292.3"""", """"NME2P1"""", """"NDUFB4P12"""")As you said, the OrgDb package doesn't have data for these Ensembl ids:> select(org.Hs.eg.db, + key=ensemblGenes, columns=columns(org.Hs.eg.db), + keytype=""""ENSEMBL"""") Error in .testForValidKeys(x, keys, keytype, fks) : None of the keys entered are valid keys for 'ENSEMBL'. Please use the keys method to see a listing of valid arguments.Using the symbols instead, we see the OrgDb has data for some of these genes but no Ensembl -> Entrez id mapping:> select(org.Hs.eg.db, key=symbols, + columns=c(""""ENTREZID"""", """"ENSEMBL""""), + keytype=""""SYMBOL"""") 'select()' returned 1:1 mapping between keys and columns SYMBOL ENTREZID ENSEMBL 1 AC016292.3 <NA> <NA> 2 NME2P1 283458 <NA> 3 NDUFB4P12 402175 <NA>biomaRt also shows no mapping between the two and is missing the symbol for the first gene:library(biomaRt) mart<- useDataset(""""hsapiens_gene_ensembl"""", useMart(""""ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL"""")) >getBM(filters=""""ensembl_gene_id"""", + attributes=c(""""ensembl_gene_id"""", """"entrezgene"""", + """"hgnc_symbol""""), + values=ensemblGenes, + mart=mart) ensembl_gene_id entrezgene hgnc_symbol 1 ENSG00000108958 NA 2 ENSG00000123009 NA NME2P1 3 ENSG00000124399 NA NDUFB4P12  Using Jo's EnsDb.Hsapiens.v79, it looks like the Ensembl id is called GENEID so we use that as 'keytype'. It also confirms no mapping between Ensembl and Entrez but it does return a value for all the symbols.> select(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v79, key=ensemblGenes, + columns=c(""""ENTREZID"""", """"SYMBOL""""), + keytype=""""GENEID"""") GENEID ENTREZID SYMBOL 1 ENSG00000108958 AC016292.3 2 ENSG00000123009 NME2P1 3 ENSG00000124399 RP11-663P9.2So for the task of mapping Ensembl ids to gene symbols it looks like the ensembl package is the most comprehensive. "	"The issue you're facing is not uncommon when dealing with gene ID conversions. The `AnnotationDbi` package in Bioconductor is a powerful tool for mapping between different types of gene identifiers, but it may not always have the most up-to-date mappings, especially for Ensembl IDs which are updated frequently.

One alternative is to use the `biomaRt` package, which queries the BioMart database directly and is generally more up-to-date. However, you've already tried this and it seems to work for you.

Another option is to use the `mapIds` function from the `AnnotationDbi` package, which is used for mapping between different types of gene identifiers. This function is used in the `map_unique` function in the `BiocSet` package to map gene IDs from Ensembl to gene symbols [doc1]. 

However, it's important to note that the `mapIds` function, like other mapping functions, may not always provide a 1:1 mapping between different types of identifiers. This is because a single gene can have multiple identifiers in different databases, and vice versa. Therefore, it's possible that some of your Ensembl IDs are not being mapped to gene symbols because there are multiple possible mappings, and `mapIds` is only returning one of them.

If you're still having trouble, you might want to consider updating your `AnnotationDbi` package, or the specific annotation package you're using (e.g., `org.Hs.eg.db` for human genes), to the latest version. This can often resolve issues with missing or outdated mappings.

Remember, this model works only on the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages. If you still have issues, please refer to https://bioconductor.org for more detailed information."	"It seems like you are doing everything correctly. The issue might be due to the version of the database you are using in AnnotationDbi. The Ensembl database is updated regularly, and sometimes the identifiers in your data might not match with the version of the database you are using.

Here are a few suggestions:

1. Update your AnnotationDbi package and the specific database you are using (like org.Hs.eg.db for human). You can do this in R using BiocManager::install() function.

2. You can use biomaRt package directly in R. It's a Bioconductor package that provides an interface to a variety of databases at the EMBL-EBI, including Ensembl. Here is an example code:

```R
library(biomaRt)
ensembl = useMart(""""ensembl"""",dataset=""""hsapiens_gene_ensembl"""")
genes = getBM(attributes=c('ensembl_gene_id', 'external_gene_name'), filters = 'ensembl_gene_id', values = your_gene_list, mart = ensembl)
```

Replace """"your_gene_list"""" with your list of Ensembl IDs.

3. You can also try other databases like """"org.Mm.eg.db"""" for mouse, """"org.Rn.eg.db"""" for rat, etc. depending on your organism.

4. If none of these work, you can manually download the latest annotation file from Ensembl and use merge() function in R to map your Ensembl IDs to gene symbols.

Remember that not all Ensembl IDs will have corresponding gene symbols as some of them might be novel or uncharacterized genes."
How do I merge a list of GRanges? What I want is a GRanges object containing the union of all the ranges and the metadata in the list. I could loop over the list, taking the union of each pair of GRanges, but the union loses the metadata. Is there a way to merge all my GRanges into one giant GRanges, with metadata? What I ultimately want is a data.frame of counts so that I can input it into limma.	"Merge is a pretty vague term. My understanding is that you want to concatenate all the GRanges objects in the list. In the R world, this concatenation is performed with c().One complication here is that the arguments to your call to c() are in a list. So you need to use do.call(""""c"""", list_of_arguments):l1 <- list(1:5, 21:22, 31:34)do.call(""""c"""", l1)  # same as c(l1[[1]], l1[[2]], l1[[3]])# [1]  1  2  3  4  5 21 22 31 32 33 34So with your list of GRanges objects do.call(""""c"""", l3) should do what you want.Alternatively, you can dounlist(as(l, """"GRangesList""""))which converts the base list object l to a GRangesList and then uses the GRL-specific unlist to merge to single GRanges object."	"You can merge a list of GRanges objects using the `reduce()` function from the GenomicRanges package. This function will merge overlapping ranges into a single range. However, as you mentioned, this operation will lose the metadata associated with each range.

To preserve the metadata, you can use the `c()` function to concatenate the GRanges objects in your list into a single GRanges object. This will preserve the metadata, but it will not merge overlapping ranges.

Here is an example of how you can do this:

```r
# Assuming gr_list is your list of GRanges objects
merged_gr <- do.call(c, gr_list)
```

After merging the GRanges objects, you can convert it into a data.frame using the `as.data.frame()` function:

```r
df <- as.data.frame(merged_gr)
```

This data.frame can then be used as input for limma.

Please note that the `c()` function will concatenate the GRanges objects, not merge them. If you want to merge overlapping ranges, you will need to use the `reduce()` function after concatenation:

```r
merged_gr <- reduce(do.call(c, gr_list))
```

However, as mentioned earlier, the `reduce()` function will lose the metadata.

Please note that this advice is based on the top 500 most used Bioconductor packages and may not apply to less commonly used packages [doc3][doc4]. If you need more specific advice, I recommend referring to the Bioconductor website (https://bioconductor.org)."	"To merge a list of GRanges objects, you can use the `reduce()` function from the GenomicRanges package in R. This function will merge overlapping ranges into a single range. However, as you mentioned, this method will not preserve the metadata.

To preserve the metadata, you can use the `c()` function to concatenate the GRanges objects in the list. This will create a single GRanges object with all the ranges and metadata from the original list.

Here is an example:

```R
# Load the required library
library(GenomicRanges)

# Assume gr_list is your list of GRanges objects
gr_list <- list(gr1, gr2, gr3)  # replace gr1, gr2, gr3 with your GRanges objects

# Concatenate the GRanges objects
merged_gr <- do.call(c, gr_list)

# If you want to sort the merged GRanges object
merged_gr <- sort(merged_gr)
```

After merging the GRanges objects, you can convert the GRanges object to a data.frame using the `as.data.frame()` function. This data.frame can then be used as input for limma.

```R
# Convert the GRanges object to a data.frame
df <- as.data.frame(merged_gr)

# Now you can use df as input for limma
```

Please note that the `c()` function will concatenate the GRanges objects as they are, without merging overlapping ranges. If you want to merge overlapping ranges, you can use the `reduce()` function after concatenating the GRanges objects.

```R
# Merge overlapping ranges
merged_gr <- reduce(merged_gr)
```

However, keep in mind that the `reduce()` function will not preserve the metadata."
